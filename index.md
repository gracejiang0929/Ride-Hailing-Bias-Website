## About Our Project

This project investigates potential biases in ride-hailing dynamic pricing algorithms, focusing on whether fare prices disproportionately impact neighborhoods with higher proportions of racial minorities in New York City. Building on prior research in Chicago and our findings on AI bias in healthcare prediction models, we aim to uncover disparities in ride-hailing fares by analyzing publicly available data from sources like New York City census data and Taxi and Limousine Commision (TLC) data on Uber and Lyft. The study involves preprocessing data, applying statistical techniques, and employing random-effects models to measure the relationship between neighborhood demographics and fare prices. We will also compare findings against traditional taxi fares to highlight differences in price discrimination. The primary output will be a research paper detailing methodologies, results, and policy recommendations to mitigate algorithmic bias, complemented by a poster presentation summarizing the findings. This work seeks to promote fairness and transparency in urban transportation systems.
