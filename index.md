# Hello World!
This is my first GitHub Pages site using Jekyll.

**Your Name**: Rongjing Jiang  
**UCSD Email Address**: rojiang@ucsd.edu  

**Section Name**: A10  
**Mentor**: Emily Ramond and Greg Thein  

## Prompts

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
Learning to use the IBM AI Fairness 360 Model to evaluate model bias using Medical Expenditure data has been particularly fascinating to me because it highlights the complexities of algorithmic fairness 
in real-world scenarios. The ability to apply fairness metrics and see their practical implications in a high-stakes domain like healthcare has helped me better understand both the power and limitations of AI models.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I am interested in investigating whether restaurants categorized by specific ethnic cuisines receive lower inspection ratings compared to non-ethnic or mainstream restaurants. 
This project could reveal biases in the inspection system, which may reflect cultural misunderstandings or stereotypes. Understanding these patterns could help improve 
the fairness of inspection practices, ultimately impacting both restaurant owners and consumers.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In Quarter 1, our group met mostly remotely, which sometimes made it difficult to communicate complex ideas effectively or keep everyone fully engaged. 
For Quarter 2, we would like to meet at least once in person to foster better collaboration, build a stronger team dynamic, and tackle challenges more efficiently 
by discussing problems directly. We believe that in-person interaction could enhance our productivity and lead to more effective brainstorming sessions.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would be interested in exploring techniques like causal inference to understand the underlying reasons behind algorithmic biases and using reinforcement learning to 
improve decision-making fairness in AI models. Additionally, I'd like to look into advanced bias mitigation methods beyond what we covered in Quarter 1, particularly those that involve adversarial debiasing.
