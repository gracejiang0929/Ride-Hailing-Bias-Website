										<!-- <p> This project investigates potential biases in ride-hailing dynamic pricing algorithms, focusing on whether fare prices disproportionately impact neighborhoods with higher proportions of racial minorities in New York City. 
											Building on prior research in Chicago and our findings on AI bias in healthcare prediction models, we aim to uncover disparities in ride-hailing fares by analyzing publicly available data from sources like 
											New York City census data and Taxi and Limousine Commision (TLC) data on Uber and Lyft.  -->
											
											<!-- The study involves preprocessing data, applying statistical techniques, and employing random-effects models to measure 
											the relationship between neighborhood demographics and fare prices.  -->
											
											<!-- We will also compare findings against traditional taxi fares to highlight differences in price discrimination. 
											The primary output will be a research paper detailing methodologies, results, and policy recommendations to mitigate algorithmic bias, complemented by a poster presentation summarizing the findings. 
											This work seeks to promote fairness and transparency in urban transportation systems. -->

											<!-- This study investigates potential biases in New York City's ride-hailing pricing algorithms, focusing on socioeconomic and demographic disparities. 
											By analyzing NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) trip data alongside neighborhood demographics, we reveal that economic vulnerability, particularly 
											in areas with high elderly poverty rates, correlates with stronger preferences for private over shared rides. 
											Our research compares standard predictive pricing models with fairness-aware alternatives, showing that fairness adjustments reduce disparities 
											but come with a moderate accuracy trade-off. -->

											This study investigates socioeconomic and demographic biases embedded in New York City’s ride-hailing pricing algorithms, combining trip data from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) with neighborhood-level demographic insights. 
											Our analysis reveals that economically vulnerable communities, particularly neighborhoods with high elderly poverty rates, disproportionately favor private rides over shared options—a preference that exacerbates financial strain. 
											By comparing conventional algorithmic pricing models with fairness-aware alternatives, we demonstrate that adjustments for equity can reduce fare disparities by up to 18%, albeit with a modest trade-off in predictive accuracy (8–12%). 
											These findings underscore the tension between profit-driven algorithmic design and equitable urban mobility, urging stakeholders to rethink how fairness is prioritized in automated systems.

										<h2 class="major">Background</h2>
										<p>
											<!-- The rapid expansion of ride-hailing platforms has introduced both opportunities and challenges in urban transportation. While these services enhance mobility, studies suggest that pricing algorithms may inadvertently reinforce economic and racial disparities. 
											Prior research indicates that neighborhoods with higher poverty rates and larger minority populations may experience more frequent surge pricing, raising concerns about fairness in dynamic fare calculations. 
											Our study builds upon existing literature by examining ride-hailing data from New York City to determine whether pricing disparities exist and, if so, how they can be mitigated through algorithmic interventions.	 -->

											Transportation and real estate systems have long played a significant role in the economic livelihood of citizens, especially in New York City. In the wake of the Great Depression, Robert Moses' "Urban Renewal Plan cut swathes through vibrant Black and Jewish communities, forcing residents to relocate to areas with less work. 'Redlining', where banks denied loans in ethnic neighborhoods, stymied the economic development of many non-white residents. The effects of these systems can be seen in the long-standing economic inequality along racial lines.
											<br><br>
											Ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Lyft have transformed urban transportation, yet their algorithms risk perpetuating systemic inequities. Research shows that low-income and majority-minority neighborhoods frequently face higher fares and more frequent surge pricing, even when demand mirrors that of wealthier areas. 
											These disparities stem from models that unintentionally amplify historical biases, such as undervaluing demand in marginalized neighborhoods or prioritizing affluent users. In New York City, where public transit gaps and economic inequality intersect, such algorithmic biases compound mobility challenges for vulnerable populations. 
											This study examines these patterns through a data-driven lens, testing interventions to align pricing systems with equity goals while maintaining operational viability.

										We began by cleaning our NYC ride-hailing dataset and computing key features, including trip
										distance, trip length, and a normalized cost metric—cost per mile (calculated as Base
										Passenger Fare divided by Trip Distance). To capture potential price discrimination, we defined
										a binary target, high_cost, by labeling rides as high cost if their cost per mile exceeded the
										median value.

										Next, we incorporated fairness into our analysis by creating protected attributes based on
										neighborhood ethnic demographics (Black, Hispanic, White, Asian, and Other). For each
										ethnicity, we generated binary indicators by comparing the respective percentage to its median
										value.
