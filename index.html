										<h2 class="major">Overview</h2>
										<p> This project investigates potential biases in ride-hailing dynamic pricing algorithms, focusing on whether fare prices disproportionately impact neighborhoods with higher proportions of racial minorities in New York City. 
											Building on prior research in Chicago and our findings on AI bias in healthcare prediction models, we aim to uncover disparities in ride-hailing fares by analyzing publicly available data from sources like 
											New York City census data and Taxi and Limousine Commision (TLC) data on Uber and Lyft. 
											
											<!-- The study involves preprocessing data, applying statistical techniques, and employing random-effects models to measure 
											the relationship between neighborhood demographics and fare prices.  -->
											
											<!-- We will also compare findings against traditional taxi fares to highlight differences in price discrimination. 
											The primary output will be a research paper detailing methodologies, results, and policy recommendations to mitigate algorithmic bias, complemented by a poster presentation summarizing the findings. 
											This work seeks to promote fairness and transparency in urban transportation systems. -->

										<h2 class="major">Background</h2>
										<p>
											The rapid expansion of ride-hailing platforms has introduced both opportunities and challenges in urban transportation. While these services enhance mobility, studies suggest that pricing algorithms may inadvertently reinforce economic and racial disparities. 
											Prior research indicates that neighborhoods with higher poverty rates and larger minority populations may experience more frequent surge pricing, raising concerns about fairness in dynamic fare calculations. 
											Our study builds upon existing literature by examining ride-hailing data from New York City to determine whether pricing disparities exist and, if so, how they can be mitigated through algorithmic interventions.

												Analysis of 4.56 million NYC TLC trips reveals average distances (4.86 miles), durations (19 minutes), and fares ($24.08 base), 
												though high variability (SD: 6.47 miles) and anomalies like negative fares suggest data quality issues. 
												Strong distance-duration (0.89) and distance-fare (0.82) correlations align with pricing models, 
												while moderate driver pay-tip links (0.56) and weaker trip metric ties highlight opportunities to refine fare strategies and optimize compensation, guiding operational decisions and predictive analytics.

											<h3 class="major">Merge Data</h3>
											<p>
												Histograms of NYC’s Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) reveal stark disparities in racial/ethnic distributions, with Asian, Black/African American, 
												and Hispanic/Latino populations concentrated in hyper-segregated pockets (e.g., 10–80% ranges), while the “Other” 
												category remains tightly clustered, reflecting NYC’s polarized neighborhood diversity. 
												A merged 60-column dataset—integrating ride-hailing trip metrics (e.g., fares, distances) with NTA 
												demographic/geographic data—was streamlined by removing redundancies and renaming technical fields, 
												enabling granular analysis of fare disparities and service accessibility across socioeconomic communities to inform equitable policy and operational strategies.

											<h3 class="major">Exploratory Data Analysis Insights</h3>
											<p>
												Analysis of NYC ride-hailing dynamics reveals peak weekday rush-hour demand, 35% surge in rain-dependent requests 
												(especially in transit-limited zones), and neighborhood-specific price elasticity (high-income areas withstand surge pricing 
												while others see demand drops), alongside 20-30% longer outer-borough wait times and higher cancellations in low-density areas. 
												These patterns highlight opportunities for zone-specific driver incentives, equity-focused pricing models, and predictive 
												algorithms to improve service reliability and reduce geographic disparities citywide.

									<p>

										We began by cleaning our NYC ride-hailing dataset and computing key features, including trip
										distance, trip length, and a normalized cost metric—cost per mile (calculated as Base
										Passenger Fare divided by Trip Distance). To capture potential price discrimination, we defined
										a binary target, high_cost, by labeling rides as high cost if their cost per mile exceeded the
										median value.

										Next, we incorporated fairness into our analysis by creating protected attributes based on
										neighborhood ethnic demographics (Black, Hispanic, White, Asian, and Other). For each
										ethnicity, we generated binary indicators by comparing the respective percentage to its median
										value.

											<h3 class="major">Fairness-Aware Model</h3>
											<p>
												We applied the ExponentiatedGradient algorithm with an
												Equalized Odds constraint. This approach ensures that the model's error rates (False
												Positive and False Negative Rates) are similar across the protected groups, thus
												mitigating bias.

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/accuracy_comp_by_ethnicity.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Equalized Odds</h3>
											<p>
												Equalized Odds was chosen because it ensures that the model's error rates—specifically the
												False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR)—are balanced across different
												groups defined by protected attributes. This means that, regardless of group membership, the
												likelihood of misclassification (either overcharging or undercharging in our context) remains
												similar, helping to mitigate discriminatory outcomes.

											<h3 class="major">ExponentiatedGradient </h3>
											<p>
												ExponentiatedGradient is a fairness-aware algorithm that enforces constraints like Equalized
												Odds during model training. It does this by iteratively reweighting training samples to minimize
												prediction error while ensuring that the fairness constraint is satisfied. This approach allows us
												to strike a balance between accuracy and fairness, reducing bias without completely sacrificing
												model performance.

								<h2 class="major">Result</h2>
								<p>
									We evaluated the performance of both a baseline logistic regression model and a fairness-aware model (using the ExponentiatedGradient algorithm 
									with an Equalized Odds constraint) across several protected attributes representing different ethnic groups (Black, Hispanic, White, Asian, and Other). 
									In all cases, the baseline model achieved an accuracy of 87.8\%. However, when fairness constraints were applied, overall accuracy generally decreased as a trade-off for reducing bias.
